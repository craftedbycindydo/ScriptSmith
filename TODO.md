## 📚 Research & Resources
- [x] Study Judge0 API integration options ✅ **RECOMMENDED FOR MVP**
- [ ] Research Monaco Editor advanced features
- [x] Investigate FastAPI best practices ✅ **CONFIRMED: Best choice for AI integration**
- [ ] Review Railway.app deployment guides
- [ ] Explore AI model integration patterns

### 🎯 **Strategic Decision: MVP vs Production**

**MVP Path (2-3 weeks):**
- Use Judge0 API for code execution (faster to market)
- Self-host Judge0 on Railway or use Judge0 CE
- Focus on UI/UX and basic functionality

**Production Path (4-6 weeks):**
- Build custom Docker execution engine
- Full control over execution environment
- Better AI integration possibilities
- More security customization

**Recommended Approach:** Start with Judge0 for MVP, then migrate to custom solution

## 🏗️ **Technical Architecture Decision Matrix**

| Feature | Judge0 API | Custom Docker | Recommendation |
|---------|------------|---------------|----------------|
| **Time to MVP** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (1-2 weeks) | ⭐⭐ (4-6 weeks) | Start with Judge0 |
| **AI Integration** | ⭐⭐ (Limited) | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Full control) | Custom for AI |
| **Security Control** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Battle-tested) | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Full control) | Both excellent |
| **Maintenance** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Minimal) | ⭐⭐ (Ongoing) | Judge0 easier |
| **Customization** | ⭐⭐ (Limited) | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Unlimited) | Custom wins |
| **Cost** | ⭐⭐⭐ (API calls) | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Infrastructure) | Custom cheaper at scale |

### 🎯 **Phase-Based Approach (RECOMMENDED)**

    A[Phase 1: Judge0 MVP] --> B[Phase 2: User Feedback]
    B --> C[Phase 3: Custom Engine]
    C --> D[Phase 4: AI Integration]
```

**Phase 1 Benefits:**
- Validate product-market fit quickly
- Learn user behavior patterns
- Generate revenue early
- Test Railway deployment pipeline

**Phase 2+ Benefits:**
- Full control for AI features
- Custom optimizations
- Better cost structure
- Unique competitive advantages

## 💡 Notes & Ideas
- Consider using Judge0 API for initial MVP to speed up development
- Implement progressive web app (PWA) features for offline coding
- Add keyboard shortcuts for better developer experience
- Consider WebAssembly for client-side code execution in future
- Plan for horizontal scaling on Railway
- **NEW**: Use Judge0's execution flow as a blueprint for custom engine
- **NEW**: Implement feature flags to switch between Judge0 and custom engine
- **NEW**: Consider hybrid approach - Judge0 for some languages, custom for AI-enhanced ones

## 🚀 **Immediate Next Steps (Start Here)**

### **Day 1-2: Project Setup**
```bash
# 1. Initialize project structure
mkdir online-ide-platform && cd online-ide-platform
mkdir frontend backend docs

# 2. Frontend setup
cd frontend
npm create vite@latest . -- --template react-ts
npm install @monaco-editor/react tailwindcss zustand axios

# 3. Backend setup  
cd ../backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install fastapi uvicorn sqlalchemy psycopg2-binary redis python-multipart

# 4. Documentation
cp TODO.md ../docs/
```

### **Week 1 Priority Tasks**
1. ✅ Complete research and planning (DONE)
2. 🔧 Set up development environment
3. 🎨 Create basic React + Monaco Editor integration
4. 🐍 Build FastAPI skeleton with basic endpoints
5. 🐳 Create initial Docker setup for local development

### **Decision Required:** Choose Your Path
- **🚀 Fast Track (Judge0)**: Get MVP in 2-3 weeks, perfect for validation
- **🏗️ Custom Track**: Build from scratch, 6-8 weeks, better for AI future

**My Recommendation**: Start with Judge0 track - you can always migrate later once you validate the concept and understand user needs.
