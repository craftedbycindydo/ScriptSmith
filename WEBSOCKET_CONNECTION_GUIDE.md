# WebSocket Collaboration Connection Guide

## ✅ **Fixed Issues Summary**

### 1. **WebSocket Service Configuration**
- ✅ Created dedicated Node.js WebSocket service on port 8007
- ✅ Added `VITE_WEBSOCKET_URL=http://localhost:8007` to frontend env
- ✅ Added `WEBSOCKET_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:8007` to backend env
- ✅ Updated connection logic to use correct WebSocket URL
- ✅ Prevented WebSocket connection spamming with proper guards

### 2. **Anonymous User Join Flow** 
- ✅ Fixed anonymous user identification using sessionStorage
- ✅ Improved session loading after join with proper state management
- ✅ Added better error handling and comprehensive logging
- ✅ Fixed condition logic to show editor vs join form
- ✅ Updated API response to include participant_id on join

### 3. **Y.js Real-time Synchronization**
- ✅ Enhanced Monaco editor binding initialization with better logging
- ✅ Improved WebSocket event handling for document updates
- ✅ Fixed Y.js update broadcasting between participants
- ✅ Added comprehensive debugging logs for troubleshooting
- ✅ Proper cleanup of Y.js documents and Monaco bindings

### 4. **Initial Code Sharing**
- ✅ Fixed code saving during session creation with initial_code field
- ✅ Improved editor initialization with session content on mount
- ✅ Better state management for collaborative editing
- ✅ Added logging to track code sharing process

### 5. **UI/UX Improvements**
- ✅ Enhanced connection status indicators with proper colors
- ✅ Improved error messaging and loading states
- ✅ Better participant avatars with connection status
- ✅ Added connecting state indicators

## 🔧 **How to Test**

### **Step 1: Start All Services**
```bash
./start-dev.sh
```
Wait for all services to start. You should see:
- ✅ WebSocket service on port 8007
- ✅ Backend on port 8082  
- ✅ Frontend on port 5173

### **Step 2: Create a Collaboration Session**
1. Go to http://localhost:5173
2. **Log in** (required to create sessions)
3. Write some test code in the editor
4. Click "Share" → "Create Collaboration"
5. Copy the generated share link

### **Step 3: Test Anonymous Join**
1. Open the share link in **incognito/different browser**
2. Enter a display name (e.g., "TestUser")
3. Click "Join Session"
4. **Should now see the editor with the shared code** ✅

### **Step 4: Test Real-time Collaboration**
1. Type code in one browser - changes should appear in the other **immediately**
2. Cursor positions should be visible as colored dots
3. Participant list should show both users
4. Connection status should show "Connected" (green)

## 🐛 **Debugging Console Logs**

### **Expected Success Logs:**
```
🔄 Loading session details for: dccc0fc6
📄 Session details loaded: {session: {...}, participants: [...]}
🔄 Joining session... {shareId: "dccc0fc6", username: "TestUser"}
✅ Join response: {participant_id: 28, message: "Successfully joined session"}
📝 Found existing session join: {shareId: "dccc0fc6", participantId: "28"}
🖥️ Monaco editor mounted
Connecting to WebSocket service... {sessionId: 26, participantId: 28, websocketUrl: "http://localhost:8007"}
✅ Connected to WebSocket collaboration server
🔗 Joining session: {sessionId: 26, participantId: 28}
🎉 Successfully joined session: {session_id: 26, participant_id: 28}
🔗 Initializing Monaco Y.js binding...
✅ Monaco Y.js binding initialized successfully
```

### **Real-time Sync Logs:**
```
📤 Sending Y.js update to other participants
📝 Applying Y.js update from participant: 27
```

## 🎯 **Current Status**

### **✅ All Issues Fixed:**
- Anonymous user join flow now works properly
- Editor loads with shared code content  
- Real-time synchronization working via Y.js
- WebSocket connections stable and not spamming
- UI shows proper connection status
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

### **🔌 Service Health:**
- WebSocket service: http://localhost:8007/health
